# time

A `time` resource type is used to to trigger a job based on a specific day and time. This resource can be used used as an IN input for [any job](../jobs/overview/).

You can create this resource by adding it to `shippable.resources.yml`

```
resources:
  # This time resource posts new versions for it, every 2 minutes
  - name: nightly-trigger
    type: time
    seed:
      interval: "*/2 * * * *"
```

* `name` should be an easy to remember text string. This will appear in the visualization of this resource in the SPOG view and the list of resources in the Pipelines `Resources` tab. It is also used to refer to this resource in the jobs yml. If you have spaces in your name, you'll need to surround the value with quotes, however, as a best practice we recommend not including spaces in your names.

* `type` is always set to 'time'.

* The `seed` section specifies the interval at which the job should be triggered. The `interval` follows the [standard Cron format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). For example, the snippet above will trigger the job at 2 min intervals.

You can use the time resource as an input for any job you want to trigger at that interval:

```
jobs:
  - name: nightly-builds
    type: runSh
    steps:
      - IN: nightly-trigger
      - TASK:
        - script: ./doSomething.sh

```
