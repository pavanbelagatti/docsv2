#IRC
You can send notifications to public using Shippable. Support for private IRC rooms coming soon.

To customize the IRC public room notifications, you'll need to configure options in the `shippable.yml` file.

There is no setting up of IRC integration through the UI.

##Configure IRC notification options in the `shippable.yml`
To configure IRC notifications for your project, add the following to the `shippable.yml` file for that project.
```
integrations:
  notifications:
    - integrationName: irc
      type: irc
      recipients:
        - "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
        - "chat.freenode.net#channel2"
      branches:
        only:
          - master
          - dev
      on_success: never
      on_failure: always
```

While the above is a sample code for your `shippable.yml`, use the descriptions of each field below to modify the `yml` and tailor it to your requirements.

- `integrationName` value is always `irc` since it is not configured in the UI - 'Account Settings' and 'Subscription' settings.
- `type` is `irc`.
- `recipients` specifies the IRC public rooms you want to send build status notifications to.
     - For single recipient, use the format `recipients: "chat.freenode.net#channel2"`
- [optional] `branches` allows you to choose the branches you want to send notifications for. By default, notifications are sent for all branches. The `only` tag should be used when you want to send notifications to specific branches. You can also use the `except` tag to exclude specific branches.
- [optional] You can set the following options for the `on_success`, `on_failure` tags:
     - The value `change` for `on_success` or `on_failure` fields means you will receive notifications only when the build status changes to success or failure respectively.
     - `always` means that you will always receive a notification for that build status.
     - `never` means that you will never receive a notification for that build status.
     - By default, `on_success` is set to `change` and `on_failure` is set to `always` when IRC is configured in the `shippable.yml` and these tags have not been specified.
- [optional] You can set the following options for the `on_start`, `on_pull_request` tags:
     - Setting the value to `always` means that you will always receive a notification for build start/pull request.
     - Setting the value to `never` means that you will never receive a notification for that build start/pull request.
     - By default, `on_start` is set to `never` and `on_pull_request` is set to `always` when IRC is configured in the `shippable.yml` and these tags have not been specified.
